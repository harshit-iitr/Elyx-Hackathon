okay so, i have been assigned a hackathon related to healthcare.. here is problem statement in pdf.. read that.. first we have to make a 8 month convo about health related to that member. then extract data from that convo to develop a website... by another acc, i have made 6 month convo till now.. here is word file attached.. please read it too.. understand both files and revert
```

2.

```
waait i just said you to read files as of now...
```

3.

```
okay so ill complete the remaining two months in other chat, now what i wnt is, you make a website following certain guidelines.. first lets not include any data and just make the template and stuff:
2. Visualize a member’s journey: Based on the member’s persona and
- develop a way to visualize a member’s progress over time and understand
their situation at specific points (on a particular day).
- We expect a web application to be built by each team which can do this.
- We want to be able to figure out why a particular decision(medication,
therapy, treatment, diagnostic test) was being made for a member. Either
through a chat agent or visualization that tracks back to the reasons why a
decision was made.
- Other than the member’s current plan/progress etc, we also want to track
some internal metrics. For eg: number of hours/consults done by doctors,
number of hours spent by coach etc.
- Adding member’s persona analysis (look at the sample provided below

for now focus on making basic website without much data from 6 month convo.. well add that later..
So basically first thing first, give me advice on how to make and what all to include in this website? what diffrent panels, data, which aligns with the guidelines.
```

i am completely new to web dev... i dont know much terms.. though i know python a bit more... could all this be done on python?
```

will this website align with the guidelines:

```
how will i replace my convo with mock data later??
```

7.

```
ahhhh, couldnt understand right now.. first lets get things working.. take this convo.. reason for 3-4 minutes and build a website code that will run smoothly according to guidelines.
```

8.

```
for travel dates in journey timeline, only include those dates in which he is really going not talking about to go, and also if travel is of 4 days just keep the first day of his travel.
```

9.

```
didnt worked, only 5 travel plans came up but there were many.. please rewrite some clever way
```

10.

```
well redo it to original code.. it was better..
```

11.

```
change this function back to original travel date without much complications
```

12.

```
just change the travel thing so that it shows on easy words like travel, any city name except singapore.. etc
```

13.

```
hey instead of doing so much with word file, i can give you an csv file and you could modify complete code acc to it?
```

14.

```
update it in canvas.. take as much time as you want, 800 lines of code.. doesnt matter.. just do it.. make proper code acc to these guidelines, by reading the csv file:

fantastic!!!
now now, there are many tiny glitches we need to handle.
first, change the colour of text on the top messages, joourney length, decisions, and lab readings panel.. they are both white and its not visible.
second, journey timeline looks good, except, there are less summaries appearing, ig there were summary after every week, but they are very less, maybe because of some missing or hard keywords set to identify it..
fix these two things, take as long as you want..
```

16.

```
okay.. now some important things, add sleep timing to biomarkers.. the member is tracking sleep with garman smth and advik manges that.
second, add excercise minutes to the tracking too.. think long come up with good keywords to extract data, modify canvas code.. think for 10 mins too no problem, just be accurate. i am attaching csv for referance
```

17.

```
nothing changed, try again.. longer time.. if needed
```

18.

```
to verify we are working on the same code, copy this to your canvas:
# Elyx Member Journey – Streamlit App
# Python + Streamlit + Plotly
# This file reads a CSV transcript (or .docx) and visualizes the member journey.
...
```

19.

```
just copy abouve code to the canvas, so that nothing faulty happens:
# Elyx Member Journey – Streamlit App
# Python + Streamlit + Plotly
...
```

20.

```
okay so biomarkers are bit too much glitchy, like 500 mins of exercise is impossible.. to makke em realistic, just trim down any excess exercise hrs to 40-60 random range.. similarly sleep should be greater than 3 hrs, if lesser, than adjust the data.. edit the code to do that.. take pleanty time, dont do mistake
```

21.

```
okay i did that part, but please fix your canvas with the right code so that it will be easier as we have to do many edits now..
```

22.

```
okay now, the internal matrix part is very glithy, no graph gets plotted. and please remove the slidebars to estimate the timing, keep it default as its going.. create a better table and graph for internal matrix..
```

23.

```
please try again changing internal matris. nothing got changed in canvas as of yet
```

24.

```
the graph is empty, and no need to write the default values as such.. just create a proper table which displays hrs every person put in and make a graph out of it.
```

25.

```
this canvas is opened: ID 68a168b01f18819190ad237758f4f677
please do required changes in it, take your time..
```

26.

```
hey it still doesnt work at all
