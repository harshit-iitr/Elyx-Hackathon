*This file contains the real prompts/instructions provided by the project owner. Each numbered item below corresponds to a single prompt. All prompts arent included, it is just a sample.*

1.

```
this is the hackathon i wanna solve with you in 3 day time, its a big problem statement, i read it, you read and save in your memory too. from what i get, we have to first create a 8 month convo between elyx doctors and member, then we have to feed the data on a website..
```

2.

```
so basically, first things first, lets design the convo and parallely store the data we get into a file that can be efficiently used while creating website. so lets start with first 5 lines of convo and preparying a relevant file type you suggest?
```

3.

```
so we dont have to copy from the sample they have given. we have to create our own plan and execute.. so first lets create basic plan for first 10 day of convo.. what it would be like, please read the data from file and understand. right now, just give me trial of first 10 day convo..
```

4.

```
alright looks great... for now forget json. and lets focus on making the convo.. this 10 day one is very very small with no timestamps.
Here is official guidelines for making convo:

Generate communication messages over 8 months from member sign up:
Whatsapp style messages will be exchanged between members and the Elyx team
members. Elyx team members with roles are provided here. Communication could
cover general queries, questions based on blood markers or wearable device data,
questions about their plan, intervention updates from Elyx, plan updates from Elyx,
and follow-ups from the Elyx team, weekly reports from Elyx.
Some restrictions you need to implement:
- 1 full diagnostic test panel needs to be done for the member every three
months to check their progress on different biomarkers.
- Assume the member also does some research or reads about health or gets
curious questions about certain topics. So, there should be up to 5
conversations started by the member per week on average.
- The member is committing 5 hours per week on average to follow the plan.
- Assume exercises are being updated every 2 weeks based on the client's
progress.
- The member travels for at least 1 week out of every 4 weeks on business
trips.
- The members’ primary place of residence is Singapore.
- If you are generating report communication, assume you can just have text
messages highlighting either the areas which have problems or tracking of
something which the member or team cares about.
- When Elyx proposes a plan, the member sticks to it properly ~50% of the
time. That means ~50% of the time, the plan needs to be changed or
improved based on the members preferences / logistics constraints.
- Remember, the member is generally not sick, but they can have 1 chronic
condition that they are managing (eg. high sugar, high BP)
```

5.

```
so lets start with only day 1, create a convo for day 1 in which he explains his history, not all cause hell explain history in one week as per guidelines:
Week 1:
- This is member onboarding.
- The member shares medical history, priorities, diets that they follow, and have test
discussions with the Elyx team.

so should i store this on word??
```

6.

```
umm , actually write the convo like its written in pdf, just date in square brackets, starting from 15th august and time and the messages so its easier to save and see in word
```

7.

```
okay so go for day 2-7 now, remember:
This is member onboarding.
- The member shares medical history, priorities, diets that they follow, and have test
discussions with the Elyx team.
